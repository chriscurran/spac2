			There are a lot of planetarium programs out there and they all do
			basically the same thing - show you what the sky looks like where you
			are. Some are 100% free, some are free but unlock more features if you buy,
			and a few are fee based only. A few popular ones with our members:

			</H4>

			Not just for beginners.... here is an explanation of the different types of telescopes and
			mounts that are available plus the capabilities of each. 


			<H4 class='resourceTopicTitles' style='margin-top:20px;'>
			<a href='resources/thelist.pdf' target='_target'>Vic Menard's observing list</a>
			</H4>

			<b>The intro paragraph:</b><i>
			The following list is a result of too many nights racing through Messier
			marathons, wandering through the Herschel 400, scanning the southern
			horizon for unexpected treasures, star-hopping for invisible faint
			fuzzies, and finally, finding myself at the helm of a 22-inch Go-To
			telescope, not knowing what to look at next! Youll no doubt recognize
			many of the objects Ive included. Many are the finest, most visited,
			destinations in the night sky. Some are the best in their class,
			although they may still seem a challenge with apertures under 20 inches.
			A few will make you yearn for your old 3-inch refractor, or dark skies
			from your earliest deep sky memories.</i>

			<H4 class='resourceTopicTitles' style='margin-top:20px;'>
				<a href='resources/dblstar2.pdf' target='_target'>Double Star observing list</a>
			</H4>

			<b>The intro paragraph:</b><i>
			 All objects are listed in Right Ascension order so that you can view
			 them as they rise, and so that you can properly plan your observing
			 sessions to make the most of your time. Information provided on each
			 object includes: a check box, object to be observed, Right Ascension,
			 Declination, magnitudes of the component stars, separation, and
			 position angle from the primary star in the double or multiple system.
