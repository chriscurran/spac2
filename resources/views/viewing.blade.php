			<strong>Directions from Tampa:</strong>
			From Tampa take I-75 North to State Rd. 52.
			Take 52 East all the way through Dade City until it dead ends at the
			railroad station on the <u><b>301 Bypass</b></u>. (Note:  State Rd. 52
			will make 2 right hand turns at traffic lights along the way, one
			after St. Leo and one when entering Dade City). Be sure to go all the
			way to the dead end at the old railroad station. <b><u>Do not turn on
			301</u></b>, go all the way to the dead end.  Turn left on 301
			<u>Bypass</u> and go about &frac34; mile until you see a Pizza Hut in
			the distance.  Just before you get to the Pizza Hut, turn right on
			River Road, across the railroad tracks.  You will see a sign saying
			"County Park 4.7 Miles".   It's a very winding, paved road, take your
			time.
			<br>
			<br>
			When you get to the fork in the road, you will take the road to
			the right (Auton Rd.).  (There's a sign saying "County Park" directing
			you to the right)  Go about 150 feet to the park entrance on the left
			(Withlacoochee Blvd.). Enter the park and go about &frac12; mile until
			you see a sign that says "Big Ma's Way", and turn right onto the
			field. If you are not camping overnight, be sure to stop at the "Pay
			Station".  Fees are $2.00 per vehicle.  You will get a card that must
			be displayed on your rear view mirror at all times while in the park.
			Failure to do so could result in a citation.

			<p>
			You can also go North on 301 from Tampa and take the bypass when you
			get to Dade City. This park closes at dusk so you will have to
			arrive before that time.  No registration is required as the first
			camper on site registers for the group and is responsible for the
			collection of the camping fees. Fees vary by season.
			There are restrooms in the park, but are a distance away
			(Approx. 300 yards).
